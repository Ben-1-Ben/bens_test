title: "Comparison of Cylindar Count to Engine Displacement"
author: "Ben Huang"
format: pdf
editor: visual

Big Dawg has commissioned this report to investigate his claim that cars with more cylinders do not have bigger engines. To address this research question, we will analyze the `mtcars` dataset and calculate the mean engine displacement for each cylinder count. This analysis will help determine if there is a relationship between the number of cylinders and engine displacement.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
mtcars
mean_displacement <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(mean_disp = mean(disp, na.rm = TRUE))
mean_displacement %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Number of Cylinders", "Mean Displacement (cu. in.)")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
mtcars
mean_displacement <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(mean_disp = mean(disp, na.rm = TRUE))
mean_displacement %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Number of Cylinders", "Mean Displacement (cu. in.)")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
ggplot(mean_displacement, aes(x = as.factor(cyl), y = mean_disp)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "black") +
  labs(title = "Mean Engine Displacement by Number of Cylinders",
       x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Mean Displacement (cu. in.)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
